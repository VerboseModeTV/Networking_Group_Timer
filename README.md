## Networking Group Timer

A couple of years ago I was part of a networking group that met over breakfast. There were about twenty people at every meeting and each person was given two minutes to introduce themselves and what kind of client there were hoping to meet.

The problem is that it's hard to talk and count to 120 at the same time. The further around the table we went, the longer each person talked. At more than one meeting we never got to the actual agenda, because introductions took up the whole time.

Around the same point, Hackaday was having an [Trinket Everyday Carry Contest](https://hackaday.io/contest/3432-trinket-everyday-carry-contest) to create a pocket sized project using a [Trinket Pro](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-pro-trinket) as the brain. I decided to kill two birds with one stone and make a timer light for the group.
